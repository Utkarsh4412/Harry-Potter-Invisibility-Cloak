# 🧥 Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak (OpenCV + Python)

This project replicates the famous invisibility cloak effect from the Harry Potter series using Python and OpenCV. It detects a specific color (cloak) and replaces it with the background, creating an illusion of invisibility.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Captures the initial background frame.
2. Uses HSV masking to detect the cloak color.
3. Masks the cloak and replaces it with the background.
4. Displays the live invisibility effect.
